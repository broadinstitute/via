/**
 * Stand-in phenotype/participant data for the phenotype-matched half of the search results.
 *
 * <p>None of this is real. The VAT is a variant-transcript aggregate table with no participant,
 * phenotype, ancestry, or age data in it at all -- and per the VAT design doc it never will have
 * (see docs/vat_schema_mapping.md), so the phenotype-matched panels need a genotype-level data
 * source that doesn't exist yet. Until it does, this makes those panels demo-able: the picked
 * condition's real participant count is split across made-up ancestry and age groups, and each
 * searched variant gets synthetic stats for a cohort of that size.
 *
 * <p>The stats are derived from the variant's real (well, synthetic-VAT) cohort-wide AoU frequency
 * and seeded off its vid, so a given variant always comes back with the same numbers and its AF
 * ratio stays consistent with the frequency shown for it in the all-participants table.
